github intro tutorial 

superheroCEO here. Otherwise known as JA. Batman or Detective will suffice too. Getting the hang of GitHub. So far, GitHub has the best, step-by-step walkthrough tutorial. I like that. But the ideal would be text + images + mini-vids. With cool edits and graphics. No one has that...yet.
